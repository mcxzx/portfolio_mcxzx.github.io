This is my personal Media Art Portfolio created in Grade 12 over 5 consecutive ill-slept days. It features a coherent art style consists of three dynamical shapes, to me now has given a scent of modernistic deconstructionism flavor.

As suggested by a fellow friend: To whom might be interested in me, I've also uploaded my resume to this repository.
There is a part of me saying: update the website, incorporate what you have done(which is quite many things, almost doubled what I know and refactored my understanding in many ways to this world) during the intermediate 2 years. But there are still endless more things seemingly more attractive for me to explore. Therefore I has no recent plan in updating this portfolio. If anyone wish to know me a bit more(that thought itself is very appreciated), one could instead view the resume.
